    Adds a `run_macroscope_review` tool that shells out to `macroscope codereview`,
    parses the streamed findings, and returns them as a `MacroscopeReview`. The agent
    validates and fixes findings with its own tools -- this capability does not edit
    files, create worktrees, or commit.

    package README). This capability cannot sign in on the user's behalf; if a review
    never starts, the tool reports that the user needs to run `macroscope` once.
